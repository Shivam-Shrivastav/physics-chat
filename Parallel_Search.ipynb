The present application has been preferred by\\n\\nthe 84 employees of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nPower Utilities who are relieved by the Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nPower Utilities, alleging willful and deliberate\\n\\ndisobedience of the directions issued by this Court in\\n\\nthe judgment and order dated 7.12.2020 approving the\\n\\nconcluding report / final report submitted by the One\\n\\nMan Committee consisting of Justice D M\\n\\nDharmadhikari, Former Judge of this Court. At this\\n\\nstage, it is required to be noted that as such the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Power Utilities have already relieved\\n\\nPage 29 of 54\\n\\nthe petitioners. However, the respondent alleged\\n\\ncontemnors \\xad Telangana State Power Utilities have not\\n\\npermitted the applicants to join the duty in the\\n\\nrespective TS Power Utilities.\\n\\n7.0. Before we proceed further to consider the present\\n\\napplication, the history which led to constitute of a\\n\\nOne Man Committee and chronological list and events\\n\\nare required to be referred to and which as such had\\n\\nbeen ultimately dealt with and considered by this\\n\\nCourt in the judgment and order dated 7.12.2020 in\\n\\nMA No.1270 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.11435 of 2018\\n\\nand other allied Applications, which are as under:\\n\\nAt this stage, it is required to be noted that in the\\n\\npresent case, the dispute is concerning the employees\\n\\nof the Telangana State Power Utilities and Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Power Utilities.\\n\\n7.1. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 was\\n\\nenacted by Parliament to provide for the reorganization\\n\\nof the existing State of Andhra Pradesh and for\\n\\nmatters connected therewith. By Section 3, Telangana\\n\\nPage 30 of 54\\n\\nState was formed comprising of the territories\\n\\nmentioned therein and by virtue of Section 4, the State\\n\\nof Andhra Pradesh was to comprise the territories of\\n\\nthe existing state of Andhra Pradesh. Section 82 of the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 reads as\\n\\nunder:\\n\\n“82. Provision for employees of Public Sector Undertakings, etc.—On and from the appointed day, the employees of State Public Sector corporations and other Undertakings, autonomous bodies shall continue to function in such undertaking, corporation or autonomous bodies for a period of one year and during this period the corporate body concerned shall determine the modalities for distributing the personnel between the two successor States.”\\n\\n7.2. The State of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh issued\\n\\ngovernment orders for Distribution Companies, for\\n\\nGeneration Companies and for Transmission\\n\\nCorporation whereby assets and liabilities of the\\n\\naforesaid corporations and companies were\\n\\napportioned between the two new States along with the\\n\\nposts sanctioned for the employees working in those\\n\\npower sector corporations/companies. However, the\\n\\nPower Utilities of the two newly formed States (Andhra\\n\\nPage 31 of 54\\n\\nPradesh Power Utilities and Telangana Power Utilities)\\n\\ncould not arrive at any consensus with regard to\\n\\nmodalities for allocation and distribution of personnel.\\n\\nThe power utilities of Telangana unilaterally relieved\\n\\n1157 employees working with power utilities of\\n\\nTelangana to join in respective power utilities of\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh. Number of employees filed writ\\n\\npetitions in High Court challenging the decision of the\\n\\npower utilities of Telangana. 242 employees, who were\\n\\nworking in power utilities of Andhra Pradesh got\\n\\nthemselves relieved and joined in power utilities of\\n\\nTelangana. The power utilities of Telangana were\\n\\nmotivated by principle of nativity, i.e., those employees\\n\\nwhose service records mentioned them as resident of\\n\\nany part of the residuary State of Andhra Pradesh were\\n\\nrelieved and those who belonged to territory of the\\n\\nnewly formed State of Telangana were permitted to join\\n\\nat Telangana by their self\\xadoption, against which writ\\n\\npetition was filed before the High Court. The High\\n\\nCourt by its common judgment dated 02.02.2018\\n\\nallowed the writ petitions, set aside the impugned\\n\\nPage 32 of 54\\n\\naction of power utilities of Telangana relieving 1157\\n\\nemployees and issued further directions. The High\\n\\nCourt specifically disapproved the principle of nativity,\\n\\nwhich was the factor for allocation of the employees by\\n\\nthe Telangana State power utilities.\\n\\n7.3. The matter reached to this Court and this Court\\n\\nupheld the order of the High Court. However, noticing\\n\\nthat two States have not been able to arrive at any\\n\\nconsensus and to finally determine the modalities for\\n\\ndistributing the personnel between two States,\\n\\nappointed One Man Committee consisting of Justice\\n\\nD.M. Dharmadhikari, a former Judge of this Court. In\\n\\nthe order dated 28.11.2018 this Court specifically\\n\\nmade it clear that the decision of the One Man\\n\\nCommittee shall be final and binding on all the parties\\n\\nincluding Power Utility Companies of the two States as\\n\\nwell as the employees and shall be executed by all the\\n\\nparties as an order of this Court. This Court also\\n\\nobserved that in case any clarification or further\\n\\ndirection is required by any of the parties they are\\n\\nPage 33 of 54\\n\\nentitled to approach this Court by filing interlocutory\\n\\napplication in the proceedings.\\n\\n7.4. That thereafter, after considering the representation by\\n\\nall concerned and the respective stake holders, the\\n\\nCommittee on 17.04.2019 had finalised XIV modalities\\n\\nto be adopted for allocation of the personnel between\\n\\ntwo States in accordance with Section 82 of the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. Thereafter,\\n\\nthe Telangana Power Generation Corporation Limited\\n\\nfiled an application questioning the modalities\\n\\nfinalised by One\\xadMan Committee. However, this Court\\n\\ndid not entertain the said application. That thereafter,\\n\\na report title as “Final Report of One\\xadMan Committee”\\n\\ndated 26.12.2019 was submitted by One\\xadMan\\n\\nCommittee. Along with the report, a final allocation list\\n\\nin the two States corporations/companies was\\n\\nprepared and annexed. List of 655 personnel, who\\n\\nwere to go from Telangana utilities to Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nutilities as submitted by sub\\xadCommittee Members on\\n\\nbehalf of Telangana utilities was approved by the\\n\\nPage 34 of 54\\n\\nHon’ble One\\xadMan Committee and was part of the final\\n\\nlist. That the Andhra Pradesh utilities were aggrieved\\n\\nby the final list communicated in the final report filed\\n\\nInterlocutory Applications. It was the case on behalf of\\n\\nthe Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities that the modalities\\n\\nhave not been correctly implemented and the list\\n\\nannexed is not in accordance with the modalities. This\\n\\nCourt disposed of the said application with following\\n\\nobservations:\\n\\n“This Court by the final judgment having entrusted the work of allocation to one man committee, as agreed by parties, the modalities finalized by one man committee is binding on all, to which, there is no dissension between the parties. There being no dispute regarding modalities, in event, there is some error or mistake in the working of the modalities that can be pointed out to the same committee by means of a representation and we hope and trust that the committee shall look into the said grievance and correct the error, if any. We also make it clear that if the representation is submitted by the applicant, copy of the same shall be given to the power utilities of both the Sates, who may also have liberty to submit a response to those representation, which may be considered by the one man committee. The representation be submitted within two weeks and response thereto be also submitted within two weeks thereafter.”\\n\\n7.5. After the order dated 24.01.2020, the One\\xadMan\\n\\nCommittee after deliberations with all stakeholders\\n\\nPage 35 of 54\\n\\nsubmitted a Supplementary Report dated 11.03.2020.\\n\\nIn the Supplementary Report, it was noticed that T.S.\\n\\npower utilities relieved employees numbering total 655\\n\\nto join A.P. power utilities. It also noted that Telangana\\n\\nPower Utilities are agreeable to accommodate 71\\n\\nemployees from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State\\n\\ncompanies as they are special cases like of spouses,\\n\\nmedical and handicapped employees or their\\n\\ndependents.\\n\\n7.6.\\n\\nIn the Supplementary Report, the One\\xadMan Committee\\n\\ndirected that the entire allocation process based on the\\n\\nallocation list with the Final\\n\\nReport and\\n\\nSupplementary Report be completed by 30.03.2020. A\\n\\nclarification dated 13.03.2020 was also issued by the\\n\\nOne\\xadMan Committee. Aggrieved by Supplementary\\n\\nReport,\\n\\nthe Telangana power utilities\\n\\nfiled\\n\\nMiscellaneous Application No. 920 of 2020 with regard\\n\\nto 584 employees, who were directed to be identified by\\n\\nSub\\xadCommittee Members of Andhra Pradesh. This\\n\\nCourt disposed of the said application observing that\\n\\nPage 36 of 54\\n\\nthe objections with regard to 584 employees were to be\\n\\nconsidered by One Man Committee.\\n\\n7.7. One\\xadMan Committee after the order of this Court dated\\n\\n01.05.2020 issued a Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020. In the Concluding Report, an allocation\\n\\nlist submitted by Andhra Pradesh utilities was\\n\\napproved. The Committee noticed that 655 employees\\n\\nhave been allocated from Telangana State to Andhra\\n\\nPradesh and equal numbers from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nTelangana including 71 names from Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nto Telangana, which was held to be of special cases\\n\\nlike spouse and medical cases. Certain further\\n\\ndirections were given by the One\\xadMan Committee in\\n\\nthe Concluding Report in paragraph 29 like approving\\n\\nthe list of Sub\\xadCommittee Members of the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh. In the Concluding Report, directions are to\\n\\nthe following effect:\\n\\n“Directions: I. In addition to the Directions contained in Para 21 of the Supplementary Report of this Committee regarding retired employees on both sides, it is further directed, that in both the States, employees who have attained or will be\\n\\nPage 37 of 54\\n\\nattaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed.\\n\\nII. In the allocation process of the present dimension and undertaken after 5 years delay, it is not possible for the Committee to satisfy individual needs and comforts and service prospects of every employee. The allocation process has been finalized on laid down principles contained in the modalities and elbow room, wherever permissible, in the modalities has been given effect to. The committee however directs the Sub Committee member of AP to re\\xad examine any left out spouse and medical cases and every attempt should be made to accommodate them in the state of their option.\\n\\nIII. All SC/ST employees cases be reexamined to accommodate them as per modality VIII in the State where they are notified as SCs or STs so as not to affect their future service growth.\\n\\nIV. All the employees finally allocated to a Public Utility will be paid regular salary from January 2020 and arrears of salary due with other benefits attached to the posts. The payments of salary partly or fully made by the Companies in the Two States in the interim period pending finalization of allocation during coronavirus pandemic, will be shared/reimbursed by the companies in the Two States mutually by paying and claiming reimbursement, if necessary, for the payments made in the interim period. It is made clear that the entire burden of salary and arrears of salary for each employee would be on the Company to which the employee is finally allocated and the said Company will reimburse interim payments pending allocation made if any by the Company to which the employee has not been finally allocated.\\n\\nV. All employees not included in the Allocation\\n\\nPage 38 of 54\\n\\nList of AP and TS and serving on \"order to serve\" basis in the Companies on the formation of the Two States in 2014 would be deemed to have been allocated to the Company where they are presently posted and working.\\n\\nVI. Based on the allocation lists, both TS and AP utilities will issue orders of posting and joining, with granting sufficient time to the employees to report for duties, keeping into consideration the constrains on movements in the current coronavirus pandemic period and the consequent lockdown imposed.\\n\\nVII. All Employers of the Power Utilities in the Two States will facilitate smooth posting and joining of employees in the Companies of the Two States and the Government and the Police Authorities of Two States will cooperate and also facilitate the movement of the employees allocated from one Company in the State to Company in another Slate.\\n\\nVIII. The allocation finally made by this committee is binding on both the employers and the employees and any violation thereof and non implementation of said allocation be reported to Supreme Court for remedial/Punitive action.”\\n\\n7.8. After the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020, a\\n\\nmember of the Sub\\xadCommittee of Andhra Pradesh\\n\\npower utilities sent a letter dated 26.06.2020 as\\n\\ncompliance report. By the said letter, 119 employees,\\n\\nwho were dropped from the list of incoming employees\\n\\nfrom Telangana State power utilities to Andhra\\n\\nPradesh power utilities and further 50 names were\\n\\nPage 39 of 54\\n\\ndropped of employees in outgoing list of employees\\n\\nfrom Andhra Pradesh power utilities to Telangana\\n\\nState power utilities and 10 further employees were\\n\\nrelieved from Andhra Pradesh power utilities for the\\n\\nreasons mentioned therein.\\n\\nAfter submission of the Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020 and follow\\xadup action taken by the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Power utilities, number of miscellaneous\\n\\napplications have been filed by Telangana State Power\\n\\nUtilities, by several employees as well as employees’\\n\\nassociations. The Telangana State Power Utilities\\n\\nGeneration Corporation prays for the following reliefs:\\n\\n“a) Clarify that the Concluding Report dated 20\\xad 06\\xad2020 submitted by the Hon’ble One\\xadMan Committee is illegal and arbitrary, being contrary to the Orders passed by this Hon’ble court and the Final Report dated 26\\xad12\\xad2019 submitted by the Hon’ble One\\xadMan Committee.\\n\\nb) Confirm the allocation of 1157 employees and 242 employees made by the Hon\\'ble One\\xadMan Committee as per Final Report dt. 26\\xad12\\xad2018, (i.e., the Allocation of 744 (502 +242) to TS Power Utilities and 655 from TS to AP Power utilities), as Final in terms of the Order dt. 28.11.2018 passed in present Civil Appeal. c) Clarify that the allocation of 4460 and 71 employees (4531) to TS Power Utilities vide Final Report dt. 26.12.2019 and Supplementary Report dt. 11.03.2020, is final and no further allocation to TS Power\\n\\nPage 40 of 54\\n\\nUtilities is Permissible.\\n\\nd) Clarify that the Supplementary Report in so far as Para No.27, authorizing the Member, Sub\\xad committee of AP to unilaterally identify and allocate 584 employees to TS Power Utilities is contrary to the orders dated 28\\xad11\\xad2018 in Civil Appeal No.11435/2018.\\n\\ne) Clarify the orders dated 28\\xad11\\xad2018 in Civil Appeal No. 11435 of 2018 passed by this Hon\\'bIe Court; and\\n\\nf) Pass such other or further order(s) as may be deemed fit and appropriate by this Hon’ble Court in the facts and circumstances of the present case.”\\n\\n7.9. Similar prayers were made by other Telangana Power\\n\\nUtilities. That by a detailed order dated 7.12.2020,\\n\\nthis Court dismissed the Miscellaneous Applications\\n\\nfiled by the Telangana State Power Utilities. While\\n\\ndismissing the respective Miscellaneous Applications\\n\\nfiled by the Telangana State Power Utilities which\\n\\nwere dismissed after considering in detailed the rival\\n\\nsubmissions/ objections against the final report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020, certain observations are made by this\\n\\nCourt, which are very relevant while considering the\\n\\npresent application, which are as under:\\n\\nPage 41 of 54\\n\\n40. We may further observe that the list of 655 employees submitted by Telangana State power utilities for allocation to Andhra Pradesh power utilities has been approved by the One\\xad Man Committee for which there is no dispute. The One\\xadMan Committee has undertaken exercise to identify the list of 655 employees from Andhra Pradesh power utilities to be transferred to Telangana State power utilities. The proceeding to balance the number of employees from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities being 655, we fail to understand that how the applicants can raise the issue regarding number of allocable employees to be considered by this Court in these proceedings.\\n\\n41.\\n\\nThe submission which has been much pressed by the learned counsel for the applicants is that number of employees allocated to Telangana State power utilities is much more as compared to those which have been allocated from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. The applicants have repeatedly in their application and their objection before the One\\xadMan Committee have referred to 502 out of 1157, 242 self\\xadrelieved employees and 71 spouse and medical cases plus 584 which have been permitted to be identified by Member of Andhra Pradesh Sub\\xad Committee. that The submission 502+242+71+584 becomes 1399, hence 1399 have been allocated to Telangana State power utilities as against 655, which has been allocated from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. We may need to look into the above submission on the basis of each figure claimed by the applicant.\\n\\nis\\n\\n42.\\n\\nNow, coming to figure 502, which according to the applicant is balance from 1157 by reducing it by 655. The 502 figure as noted above, 1157 is the number of persons, which were initially\\n\\nPage 42 of 54\\n\\nrelieved by Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities unilaterally which decision was set aside by the High Court and was upheld by this Court. Out of 1157 only 655 have been allocated to Andhra Pradesh power utilities, which was approved by Final Report dated 26.12.2019 of the One\\xad Man Committee. How allocation of 502 is claimed when they are the employees, who remained on Telangana State without they being allocated to Andhra Pradesh power utilities apart from 655 from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh. Further employees working in Telangana State were allowed to remain in Telangana State, hence, allocation from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh is only 655 and addition of 502 is wholly inappropriate.\\n\\n43.\\n\\nNow, we come to number 242, which is number of self\\xadrelieved employees from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. Admittedly, 242 employees are, thus, who got themselves self\\xad relieved from Andhra Pradesh without there being any order or without there being any direction by anyone. These 242 employees were permitted joining by Telangana power utilities by its own. These 242 employees having never been allocated to nor being part of any allocation cannot be added in figure by Telangana State. Now, we come to 71, which is agreed spouse and medical ground cases by both the parties. 71 is part of 655, which is now being identified by Andhra Pradesh to be allocated to Telangana State. By taking this no.71 in Supplementary Report permitting Andhra Pradesh to identify only 584, thus, it is only 584+71, i.e., 655 employees, which are now being sought to be allocated to the Telangana State by One Man Committee. We, thus, do not find any merit in the contention of the applicant that 1399 employees have been allocated to Telangana State as against 655 allocated from Telangana State to Andhra\\n\\nPage 43 of 54\\n\\nPradesh.\\n\\n46.\\n\\nThe objection that list of 584 is not out of 2165 was considered by the One\\xadMan Committee, which is reflected from the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020. The above objection has been duly considered and answered by the One\\xadMan Committee in paragraphs 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Concluding Report, which is to the following effect:\\xad\\n\\n“25. The second submission on behalf of TS is that with the Supplementary Report, this Committee had Identified total 2165 employees in the list given to AP Sub for proposing Committee member allocation from that list. It is urged on behalf of TS, that allocation list proposed by AP is not out of 2165 listed employees with the Supplementary Report of this Committee.\\n\\n26. It is true, as urged on behalf of TS, that with the Supplementary Report, this Committee had identified 2165 employees bused on modality Nos. 5 which requires consideration of every employee for his home district and his adjustment as far as possible in the State in which his home district falls.\\n\\n27. This Committee has to be open to correction. The Committee is also of the view that modality No. V alone is not decisive and modalities no. I to IV are to be cumulatively taken into consideration and applied to make allocation in proportion to the available posts in each Company in the Two States. TS side has accepted that 114 employees from out of 584 employees proposed for allocation by A.P to T.S are included in 2165 employees identified by this Committee in the lint\\n\\nPage 44 of 54\\n\\nannexed with Supplementary Report. The remaining 470 employees (falling outside 2165 employees identified with the supplementary report) have been proposed by A.P for T.S in the report of the Sub Committee Member. The justification shown is that it is to match the number of employees with the available posts in various companies.\\n\\n28. In the above circumstances, mentioned above, this Committee finds the Allocation Lists company\\xadwise and post\\xadwise proposed by AP deserves approval and it is so approved.”\\n\\n48.\\n\\nNow, one more objection of the applicants, which needs to be noticed is the objection that even the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020 is not final report and Sub\\xadCommittee Member of Andhra Pradesh has been authorised to modify the list. Applicants have referred to direction Nos. I, II and III of the Concluding Report, which is to the following effect:\\xad\\n\\nI. In addition to the Directions contained in Para 21 of the Supplementary Report of this Committee regarding retired employees on both sides, it is further directed, that in both the States, employees who have attained or will be attaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed.\\n\\nII. In the allocation process of the present dimension and undertaken after 5 years delay, it is not possible for the Committee to satisfy individual needs and comforts and service prospects of every employee. The allocation process has been finalized on laid down principles contained in the modalities and elbow room, wherever\\n\\nPage 45 of 54\\n\\npermissible, in the modalities has been given effect to. The committee however directs the Sub Committee member of AP to re\\xadexamine any left\\xadout spouse and medical cases and every attempt should be made to accommodate them in the state of their option.\\n\\nIII. All SC/ST employees cases be reexamined to accommodate them as per modality VIII in the State where they are notified as SCs or STs so as not to affect their future service growth.\\n\\n49.\\n\\nNow, we first take the direction No.I of the One Man Committee that those who have attained or will be attaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed. in paragraph 21, the One\\xadMan Committee has stated:\\xad\\n\\nIn Supplementary Report\\n\\n“21. It was also agreed by the Parties that all retired employees between years 2014 to 2020 in each Power Utility in each State need not be displaced only for pensioner benefits payable to them.”\\n\\n50.\\n\\nThe above indicates that both the parties had agreed before the One\\xadMan Committee that all retired employees between years 2014 to 2020 in each power utility in each State need not be displaced. Thus, the above was agreement between both the parties before the One\\xadMan Committee and direction No.I only an extension of the said agreement, i.e., whoever shall be attaining 58 years of age in 2020 shall be kept out of allocation process. As per paragraph 21 of the Supplementary Report, those, who retire till then were already kept out of the allocation and the extension till the end of 2020 cannot be said to be unreasonable. The allocation process\\n\\nPage 46 of 54\\n\\nbeing not yet finalised and awaiting finalisation for last several years, those who retire either in Telangana State or Andhra Pradesh has rightly been decided not to be displaced only for the purpose of shouldering pensionary liability. The direction No.I is equitable.\\n\\n51.\\n\\nThe applicants further submit that after the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020 by letter dated 26.06.2020, Andhra Pradesh power utilities have struck 119 names from the incoming 655 list from the Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. We are of the view that the said dropping is only consequential to the decision of the One\\xadMan Committee as reflected in paragraph 21 of Supplementary Report and direction No.I of Concluding Report. The Andhra Pradesh power utilities have also deleted 50 names from the list of 584 employees outgoing from Andhra Pradesh power utilities to Telangana State power utilities, which was again in compliance of the One\\xadMan Committee’s decision. Any consequential action taken in pursuance of the Concluding Report cannot be said to be not contemplated by the final Concluding Report or cannot be said to be an open ended report. The consequence of Concluding Report has to be taken to its logical ends. Further, 10 employees have been added by direction Nos. II and the reasons have been given in the letter dated 26.06.2020 for relieving them, which is again consequence of direction Nos.I and II. We, thus, are of the view that the One\\xadMan Committee has considered all materials and objections placed before it by both sides including the representation of the employees and employees organisations submitted from time to time. The process which was initiated by submitting Final Report dated 26.12.2019 was supplemented by Supplementary Report dated 11.03.2020 and\\n\\nPage 47 of 54\\n\\nConcluding Report dated 20.06.2020. The One\\xad Man Committee being aware of all objections and having taken a conscious decision to finalise the allocation between two States, we do not find any such error in the process which may warrant any clarification or direction by this Court. We may further notice that the exercise undertaken by the One\\xadMan Committee is to allocate 655 from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh and same number from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. Apart from the above two allocations, other personnel, who were working in Telangana State and Andhra Pradesh were not disturbed by allocation.\\n\\n52.\\n\\nLearned counsel for the applicants have also taken exception to reciprocity of 655 number. We do not find that there is any error in reciprocity. The One\\xadMan Committee took a decision that when 655 employees are coming from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh, same number should go from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. In the Concluding Report, final list has been annexed, which is utility\\xad wise and personnel\\xadwise, which is clear and unambiguous. We, thus, do not find any merit in the Miscellaneous Applications filed by Telangana State power utilities being M.A. Nos. 1286, 1290, 1292 and 1291, which are dismissed.”\\n\\n8.0. Thus, from the above, it is apparent that this Court\\n\\nspecifically observed and held that the Final Report\\n\\ndated 26.12.2019 submitted by the One Man\\n\\nCommittee along with allocation list is final and\\n\\nconclusive and is binding to both the States and\\n\\nPage 48 of 54\\n\\nrespective Power Utilities viz. Telangana Power\\n\\nUtilities and Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities. The only\\n\\nexception was with respect to those employees who\\n\\nattained the age of 58 years in the year 2020. Those\\n\\nemployees with the consent of the respective Power\\n\\nUtilities were kept out of allocation process. It is to be\\n\\nnoted that the respective applicants – 84 petitioners\\n\\nfigured in the final list prepared by One Man\\n\\nCommittee. The names of the petitioners are duly\\n\\nmentioned in the said list of the One Man Committee\\n\\nReport which is prepared Utilities wise. Out of 84\\n\\npetitioners and as per the Final List of 28 petitioners\\n\\nhad to be absorbed in TS Genco, 35 petitioners had to\\n\\nbe absorbed in TS Transco and 21 petitioners had to\\n\\nbe absorbed in TS Discoms. As observed herein\\n\\nabove, the respective Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities\\n\\nhave already relieved respective petitioners and\\n\\nthereafter they are no more continued with their\\n\\nerstwhile employers – Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities\\n\\nrespectively. Therefore, once the names of the 84\\n\\npetitioners figured in the Final List prepared by the\\n\\nPage 49 of 54\\n\\nOne Man Committee and the Final Report has been\\n\\naccepted and approved by this Court and it is directed\\n\\nthat both the States and their respective State Power\\n\\nUtilities are bound by the Final Report of the One\\n\\nMan Committee and Final List prepared and\\n\\ncommunicated with the Supplementary Report / Final\\n\\nReport, thereafter any deviation from the same would\\n\\ntantamount to willful disobedience of the directions\\n\\nissued by this Court. At this stage, it is required to be\\n\\nnoted that in the earlier order, this Court has\\n\\nspecifically observed and made it clear that the\\n\\ndecision of the One Man Committee shall be final and\\n\\nbinding on all the parties including the Power Utilities\\n\\nCompanies of the two States as well as employees and\\n\\nshall be executed by all the parties as an order of this\\n\\nCourt. In that view of the matter, the respective\\n\\nsubsequent office orders dated 17.12.2020 (issued by\\n\\nthe TS Genco), office order dated 18.12.2020 (issued\\n\\nby the TS Transco), office order dated 18.12.2020\\n\\n( issued by the TSNPDCL) and the office order dated\\n\\n19.12.2020 (issued by the TSSPDCL) are just contrary\\n\\nPage 50 of 54\\n\\nto the directions issued by this Court and contrary to\\n\\nthe Supplementary Report / Final Report submitted\\n\\nby the One Man Committee dated 20.06.2020 which\\n\\nwould tantamount to willful disobedience of the\\n\\ndirections issued by this Court. Again, the Telangana\\n\\nState Power Utilities have raised the same issues with\\n\\nrespect to the Reciprocity and Financial Neutrality,\\n\\nwhich were earlier raised before this court by filing\\n\\nrespective Miscellaneous Applications and same came\\n\\nto be dismissed by this court vide order dated\\n\\n7.12.2020. Thereafter, to raise the same objections /\\n\\nissues again by the Telangana State Power Utilities\\n\\nwould tantamount to willful disobedience of the\\n\\ndirections issued by this Court. Telangana State\\n\\nPower Utilities cannot be permitted to raise the same\\n\\nobjections / issues again and again, which were\\n\\nearlier raised before this Court and this Court held\\n\\nagainst the Telangana State Power Utilities. There\\n\\nmust be an end to a litigation. By permitting the\\n\\nTelangana State Power Utilities and /or any other\\n\\nparties to raise the issues / objections again and\\n\\nPage 51 of 54\\n\\nagain, the object and purpose of constituting One\\n\\nMan Committee by this Court would be frustrated.\\n\\nThis Court purposefully directed to constitute the One\\n\\nMan Committee consisting of Mr. Justice D M\\n\\nDharmadhikari, Former Judge of this Court to put an\\n\\nend to the litigation with respect to the allocation of\\n\\nthe employees and other disputes with respect to the\\n\\nrespective Power Utilities of both the States.

However, TS Power Utilities have\\n\\narbitrarily and unilaterally left out the petitioners\\n\\ncontrary to the judgment dated 7.12.2020.\\n\\n3.1.\\n\\nIt is submitted by Shri Ahmadi that a perusal of the\\n\\njudgment and order dated 7.12.2020 passed by this\\n\\nCourt would show that the objections of TS Power\\n\\nUtilities, with regard to the excess allocation and also\\n\\nwith regard to the reciprocity, in respect of 655\\n\\nnumbers, were categorically rejected and the final list\\n\\nappended to the Concluding Report has been expressly\\n\\naffirmed.

It is submitted that\\n\\nsaid second list is appended only to cause confusion\\n\\nand none of the employees in the second list are part\\n\\nof the final lists of TS Genco, TS Transco, TSSPDCL or\\n\\nPage 6 of 54\\n\\nTSNPDCL as per the Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020 r/w compliance report dated 26.06.2020.\\n\\n3.7.\\n\\nIt is further submitted by Shri Ahmadi learned Senior\\n\\nAdvocate that despite express directions from this\\n\\nCourt read with directions of Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020, the respondent contemnors \\xad TS Power\\n\\nUtilities are in willful disobedience in not having\\n\\nimplemented the allocation made by the One Man\\n\\nCommittee as per the final list, leaving the petitioners,\\n\\nwho were to be absorbed in the power utilities of the\\n\\nTelangana State high and dry. It is submitted that\\n\\nnon\\xadcompliance is borne out by the following:\\n\\n(I).\\n\\nThat the office order dated 17.12.2020 issued by the\\n\\nTS Genco which is contrary to the report of the One\\n\\nMan Committee accepted by this Court;\\n\\nA.\\n\\nthat as per report of the One Man Committee, TS\\n\\nGenco was to absorb 300 employees in total, from AP\\n\\nGenco;\\n\\nB.\\n\\nthat since TS Genco has already admitted 26\\n\\nemployees in terms of Supplementary Report dated\\n\\nPage 7 of 54\\n\\n11.03.2020, the total employees to be admitted by TS\\n\\nGenco ought to be 300 as per the judgment dated\\n\\n7.12.2020;\\n\\nC.\\n\\nthat however, TS Genco has reduced this number of\\n\\n226 employees and resultantly 28 petitioners are\\n\\ndropped their allocation to TS Genco held to be\\n\\nabsolute and all 28 petitioners have not attained the\\n\\nage of 58 years and thus are outside the purview of\\n\\ndirection. It is submitted that this is contrary to the\\n\\njudgment of this Court, the direction no. I stipulates to\\n\\nexclude retired persons from TS Genco allocation list\\n\\nannexed to Concluding Report and none of the\\n\\npetitioners are retired in terms of Direction No.I;\\n\\nD.\\n\\nthat therefore, TS Genco have devised the office order\\n\\nto circumvent the orders of this Court with jugglery of\\n\\nthe numbers and truncating the allocation lists and\\n\\ncontemnors are guilty of dropping 28 petitioners, as a\\n\\nresult of willful disobedience of the order of this Court;\\n\\nE.\\n\\nthat the list of employees absorbed does not include\\n\\nthe 28 petitioners who were already included in the\\n\\nfinal list of the One Man Committee. It is submitted\\n\\nPage 8 of 54\\n\\nthat the said lists annexed to office order are prepared\\n\\nto confuse the tally of allocation lists and to suppress\\n\\nthe fact that TS Genco has absorbed only 226 (out of\\n\\n300), a list of 252(226 + 26) has been appended to\\n\\noffice order to mislead this Court by repeating the\\n\\nsame 26 employees who were already admitted on\\n\\n11.03.2020 vide Supplementary Report of One Man\\n\\nCommittee. It is submitted that further a list of 48\\n\\nemployees is appended, these are employees who were\\n\\nnever part of 300 employees allocated to TS Genco and\\n\\nthe list is fraudulently appended, just to display and\\n\\nmatch the numbers.\\n\\n3.8.\\n\\nIt is further submitted that similarly office order dated\\n\\n18.12.2020 issued by the TS Transco is nothing but a\\n\\nwillful disobedience of the judgment and order passed\\n\\nby this Court dated 20.06.2020 and 7.12.2020\\n\\naccepting the report of the One Man Committee. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that as per the Concluding Report, TS\\n\\nTransco was to absorb 173 employees from AP\\n\\nTransco. It is submitted that since TS Transco had\\n\\nPage 9 of 54\\n\\nalready admitted 30 employees in terms of\\n\\nSupplementary Report dated 11.03.2020, the total\\n\\nemployees to be admitted by TS Transco ought to be as\\n\\nper the judgment dated 7.12.2020. It is submitted that\\n\\nhowever, TS Transco has reduced this number to 104\\n\\nemployees and resultantly 35 petitioners are dropped\\n\\ndespite their allocation to TS Transco held to be\\n\\nabsolute and all 35 petitioners have not attained the\\n\\nage of 58 years and thus are outside the purview of\\n\\nDirection I. It is submitted that this is contrary to the\\n\\njudgment of this Court, the Direction No.I only\\n\\nstipulates to exclude Retired persons from TS Transco\\n\\nlist annexed to Concluding Report and none of the\\n\\npetitioners are retired in terms of Direction No. I. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that TS Transco issued office order\\n\\naudaciously ignoring the allocation made under\\n\\nDirection No.II & III as approved by this Court. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that therefore, TS Transco have devised the\\n\\noffice order to circumvent the orders of this Court with\\n\\njugglery of the numbers and truncating the allocation\\n\\nlists and contemnors are guilty of dropping 35\\n\\nPage 10 of 54\\n\\npetitioners as a result of willful disobedience of the\\n\\norder of this Court. It is submitted that the list of\\n\\nemployees absorbed does not include the 35\\n\\npetitioners who were already included in the final list\\n\\nof the One Man Committee. The said lists annexed to\\n\\noffice order are prepared to confuse the tally of\\n\\nallocation lists and suppress the fact that TS Transco\\n\\nhas absorbed only 104 (out of (173 +8), a list of 134\\n\\n(104 +30) has been appended to office order to mislead\\n\\nthis Court by repeating the same 30 employees who\\n\\nwere already admitted on 11.03.2020 vide\\n\\nSupplementary Report of One Man Committee. It is\\n\\nfurther submitted that the employees who were never\\n\\npart of 173 employees allocated just to TS Transco and\\n\\nthe list is fraudulently appended to display and match\\n\\nthe number.\\n\\n3.9.\\n\\nIt is further submitted that even the office order dated\\n\\n18.12.2020 issued by the TSNPDCL would also\\n\\ntantamount to contempt and willful disobedience of\\n\\nthe judgment and order passed by this Court. It is\\n\\nPage 11 of 54\\n\\nsubmitted that as per the Concluding Report,\\n\\nTSSPDCL was to absorb 113 employees from\\n\\nAPSPDCL. It is submitted that since TSSPDCL had\\n\\nalready admitted 15 employees in terms of\\n\\nSupplementary Report dated 11.03.2020, the total\\n\\nemployees to be admitted by TASSPDCL ought to be\\n\\n(113+2) as per the judgment dated 07.12.2020. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that however, TSSPDCL has reduced this\\n\\nnumber to 66 employees and resultantly 20 petitioners\\n\\nare dropped despite their allocation to TSSPDCL held\\n\\nto be absolute and all 20 petitioners have not attained\\n\\nage of 58 years and thus are outside the purview of\\n\\nDirection I. It is submitted that this is contrary to the\\n\\njudgment of this Court, the Direction No.I only\\n\\nstipulates to exclude Retired persons from TSSPDCL\\n\\nAllocation list annexed to the Concluding Report and\\n\\nnone of the petitioners are retired in terms of Direction\\n\\nNo.I. It is submitted that TSSPDCL issued office order\\n\\naudaciously ignoring the allocation made under\\n\\nDirection Nos. II & III as approved by this Court. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that therefore, TSSPDCL have devised the\\n\\nPage 12 of 54\\n\\noffice order to circumvent the orders of this Court with\\n\\njugglery of the numbers and truncating the allocation\\n\\nlists and contemnors are guilty of dropping 20\\n\\npetitioners as a result of willful disobedience of the\\n\\norder of this Court. It is submitted that the list of\\n\\nemployees absorbed does not include the 20\\n\\npetitioners who were already included in the final list\\n\\nof the One Man Committee. The said lists annexed to\\n\\noffice order are prepared to confuse the tally of\\n\\nallocation lists and suppress the fact that TSSPDCL\\n\\nhas absorbed only 66 (out of (113 +2), a list of 81 (66\\n\\n+15) has been appended to office order to mislead this\\n\\nCourt by repeating the same 15 employees who were\\n\\nalready admitted on 11.03.2020 vide Supplementary\\n\\nReport of One Man Committee. It is further submitted\\n\\nthat the employees who were never part of 113\\n\\nemployees allocated just to TSSPDCL and the list is\\n\\nfraudulently appended to display and match the\\n\\nnumber.\\n\\n3.10. It is further submitted by Shri Ahmadi learned Senior\\n\\nPage 13 of 54\\n\\nAdvocate that the office order dated 19.12.2020 issued\\n\\nby the TSNPDCL is also in teeth of the judgment and\\n\\norder passed by this Court. It is submitted that as per\\n\\nthe Concluding Report, TSNPDCL was to absorb 69\\n\\nemployees from APLPDCL & APSPDCL. It is submitted\\n\\nthat since TSNPDCL, the net employees to be admitted\\n\\nby TSSPDCL ought to be 69 as per the judgment dated\\n\\n07.12.2020. It is submitted that however, TSNPDCL\\n\\nhas reduced this number to 60 employees and\\n\\nresultantly petitioner no.83 is dropped despite their\\n\\nallocation to TSNPDCL held to be absolute and the\\n\\nsaid single petitioner has not attained age of 58 years\\n\\nand thus are outside the purview of Direction I. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that this is contrary to the judgment of this\\n\\nCourt, the Direction No.I only stipulates to exclude\\n\\nRetired persons from TSNPDCL Allocation list annexed\\n\\nto the Concluding Report and petitioner no.83 is not\\n\\nretired in terms of Direction No.I. It is submitted that\\n\\ntherefore, TSNPDCL have devised the office order to\\n\\ncircumvent the orders of this Court with jugglery of the\\n\\nnumbers and truncating the allocation lists and\\n\\nPage 14 of 54\\n\\ncontemnors are guilty of dropping 1 petitioner as a\\n\\nresult of willful disobedience of the order of this Court.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the list of employees absorbed\\n\\ndoes not include the petitioner no.83 who was already\\n\\nincluded in the final list of the One Man Committee.\\n\\nThe said lists annexed to office order are prepared to\\n\\nconfuse the tally of allocation lists and suppress the\\n\\nfact that TSNPDCL has absorbed only 60 (out of 69),\\n\\nbut a list 65 has been appended to office order to\\n\\nmislead this Court. It is further submitted that the\\n\\nemployees who were never part of 69 employees\\n\\nallocated just to TSNPDCL and the list is fraudulently\\n\\nappended to display and match the number.\\n\\n3.11. It is submitted that from the above, it is apparent that\\n\\nTS Power Utilities have not implemented the judgment\\n\\ndated 7.12.2020 passed by this Court. It is submitted\\n\\nthat after confirmation of the Concluding Report of the\\n\\nOne Man Committee and allocation lists, this was only\\n\\na mechanical exercise of admission of the employees\\n\\nbased on the lists, but TS Power Utilities have\\n\\nPage 15 of 54\\n\\nreopened the entire lists and indulged in unilateral\\n\\npick and choose.\\n\\n3.12. It is submitted that in terms of direction VI of the One\\n\\nMan Committee, the petitioners are to be given posting\\n\\nand joining orders.

Accordingly,\\n\\nequal number of employees i.e. 123 members were\\n\\nremoved from the list of allocable employees from\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh to Telangana State on the principle of\\n\\nReciprocity and Financial Neutrality. It is submitted\\n\\nthat in the process of removing 123 members, the 71\\n\\nemployees already allocated have not been disturbed.\\n\\nAccordingly, 456 employees are allocable from Andhra\\n\\nPradesh to Telangana State. In respect of two\\n\\nemployees allocable from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nPage 22 of 54\\n\\nTelangana State, a clarification has been sought for,\\n\\nfrom the Andhra Pradesh.\\n\\n4.4.\\n\\nIt is submitted that thus the TS Power Utilities have\\n\\nimplemented the judgment dated 7.12.2020 and\\n\\nConcluding Report dated 20.06.2020 of the One Man\\n\\nCommittee in its true spirit. It is submitted that thus,\\n\\nthe excess employees relieved from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nTelangana State are 83 (615\\xad532=83).\\n\\n4.5.\\n\\nIt is submitted that in the process of allocation of\\n\\nemployees, One Man Committee has allocated 71\\n\\nemployees working in Andhra Pradesh to Telangana\\n\\nState on spouse and medical grounds. They were\\n\\ntreated as part of allocable employees in reciprocation\\n\\nof 655 already allocated to Andhra Pradesh vide Final\\n\\nReport dated 26.12.2019. It is submitted that\\n\\ntherefore, Andhra Pradesh was directed to identify\\n\\nremaining 584 (655\\xad71) vide the Supplementary\\n\\nReport dated 11.3.2020.\\n\\n4.6.\\n\\nIt is submitted that on implementation of the Direction\\n\\nPage 23 of 54\\n\\nNo. II of Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020, the\\n\\nsame procedure is to be followed by the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh whereas Andhra Pradesh vide letter dated\\n\\n26.8.2020 identified 10 employees, who are shown\\n\\nover and above allocable 655 employees, which is just\\n\\ncontrary to the reports of the One Man Committee. It is\\n\\nfurther submitted that it is open for the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh to adjust the said employees within the\\n\\nReciprocation ratio and in proportion to allocated\\n\\nemployees from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh.\\n\\n4.7.\\n\\nIt is submitted by learned counsel for the Telangana\\n\\nState Power Utilities that entire allocation process\\n\\nundertaken by the One Man Committee is on the\\n\\nprinciple of reciprocity and the same was reiterated in\\n\\npara no.21 of the Concluding Report. It is submitted\\n\\nthat since 655 employees are already allocated vide\\n\\nFinal Report dated 26.12.2019 from Telangana to\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh, equal number were allocable from\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh to Telangana State. It is submitted\\n\\nthat the One Man Committee had taking into\\n\\nPage 24 of 54\\n\\nconsideration of 71 employees already allocated,\\n\\ndirected the Andhra Pradesh to furnish a list of 584\\n\\nemployees and the same were included as Annexure to\\n\\nthe Concluding Report. In the process of\\n\\nimplementation of Directions of Concluding Report\\n\\ndated 20.06.2020, 123 employees are deleted by\\n\\nTelangana State. It is submitted that therefore, the\\n\\nallocable employees from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nTelangana State shall also stand reduced from 655 to\\n\\n532 (655\\xad123=532). It is submitted that further 10\\n\\nemployees allocated under Direction No.II are to be\\n\\naccommodated within 532 including 71 employees\\n\\nalready allocated. However, the Andhra Pradesh has\\n\\nnot undertaken any exercise thereby leading to\\n\\nretention of 83 employees allocable from Andhra\\n\\nPradesh to Telangana State, which lead to the present\\n\\nsituation. It is submitted that instead of rectifying the\\n\\nsame, Andhra Pradesh is seeking to justify their stand\\n\\nby filing intervention petition, which is unjustified.\\n\\n4.8.\\n\\nIt is further submitted that the principle of reciprocity\\n\\nPage 25 of 54\\n\\nhas been approved by this Court in its judgment dated\\n\\n7.12.2020 (para 26, 41 & 42). It is submitted that this\\n\\nCourt has further observed that the implementation of\\n\\nthe direction cannot be termed as modification of the\\n\\nConcluding Report and both the Power Utilities were\\n\\ndirected to implement the same. It is submitted that\\n\\nthus there is no violation on the part of the TS Power\\n\\nUtilities in the implementation of the orders dated\\n\\n7.12.2020.\\n\\nMaking above submissions, it is prayed to\\n\\ndismiss the present contempt petition and to direct\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Power Utilities to retain the\\n\\ncorresponding 83 employees deleted from the list of\\n\\nemployees allocable from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nTelangana duly adhering to the principle of reciprocity\\n\\nand financial neutrality.\\n\\n5.0. Shri Niraj Kishan Kaul, learned Senior Advocate\\n\\nappearing on behalf of the intervenors\\xad Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Power Utilities has submitted that the\\n\\nrespective alleged contemnors have committed\\n\\nPage 26 of 54\\n\\napparent contempt of the judgment and order passed\\n\\nby this Court dated 7.12.2020.\\n\\n5.1.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the allocation list approved by the\\n\\nOne Man Committee in the Final Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020 is final and the same is to be implemented\\n\\nby the both the Power Utilities without justifying the\\n\\nallocation list. It is submitted that TS Power Utilities\\n\\nhave devised office orders only to reopen and review\\n\\nthe allocation exercise which is already concluded and\\n\\napproved by this Court (Direction No.I).\\n\\n5.2.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the retired / retiring employees are\\n\\nnot part of the financial burden as it was agreed by\\n\\nboth the sides to keep them out of allocation exercise.\\n\\nIt is submitted that financial neutrality was already in\\n\\nplace while preparing 655 = 655. It is submitted that\\n\\ntherefor, thereafter it does not lie in mouth of any\\n\\nutility that retired / retiring employees are financial\\n\\nburden on them.\\n\\n5.3.\\n\\nIt is further submitted that a perusal of the judgment\\n\\nPage 27 of 54\\n\\ndated 7.12.2020 would show that the objection of TS\\n\\nPower Utilities with regard to excess allocation and\\n\\nalso with regard to the reciprocity, in respect of 655\\n\\nnumber were categorically rejected and the final list\\n\\nappended to the Concluding Report was expressly\\n\\naffirmed. It is submitted that there is expressed\\n\\ndirection to the Power Utilities of both the States and\\n\\nall concerned to implement the report of the One Man\\n\\nCommittee.\\n\\n5.4.\\n\\nIt is submitted that TS Power Utilities has been\\n\\ninvolved in jugglery of figures and they have brought\\n\\nnew figures time and again to delay and confuse the\\n\\nallocation process.\\n\\n5.5.\\n\\nIt is submitted that in terms of direction (VI) of the One\\n\\nMan Committee both the TS and Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nPower Utilities were required to issue order of posting\\n\\nof their joining and granting sufficient time to the\\n\\nemployee to report for duty. It is submitted that the\\n\\nsaid direction has been followed by the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Utilities, however Telangana Utilities /\\n\\nPage 28 of 54\\n\\nTelangana State has unilaterally altered the allocation\\n\\nlist and denied posting and joining orders to 84\\n\\npetitioners, which is just contrary to the judgment and\\n\\norder passed by this Court dated 7.12.2020 and the\\n\\nConcluding Report dated 20.06.2020. It is submitted\\n\\nthat the respondent contemnors have disregarded the\\n\\nsoul of the allocation exercise and are in serious willful\\n\\ncontempt of this Court.\\n\\n6.0. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at\\n\\nlength. The present application has been preferred by\\n\\nthe 84 employees of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nPower Utilities who are relieved by the Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nPower Utilities, alleging willful and deliberate\\n\\ndisobedience of the directions issued by this Court in\\n\\nthe judgment and order dated 7.12.2020 approving the\\n\\nconcluding report / final report submitted by the One\\n\\nMan Committee consisting of Justice D M\\n\\nDharmadhikari, Former Judge of this Court. At this\\n\\nstage, it is required to be noted that as such the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Power Utilities have already relieved\\n\\nPage 29 of 54\\n\\nthe petitioners. However, the respondent alleged\\n\\ncontemnors \\xad Telangana State Power Utilities have not\\n\\npermitted the applicants to join the duty in the\\n\\nrespective TS Power Utilities.\\n\\n7.0. Before we proceed further to consider the present\\n\\napplication, the history which led to constitute of a\\n\\nOne Man Committee and chronological list and events\\n\\nare required to be referred to and which as such had\\n\\nbeen ultimately dealt with and considered by this\\n\\nCourt in the judgment and order dated 7.12.2020 in\\n\\nMA No.1270 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.11435 of 2018\\n\\nand other allied Applications, which are as under:\\n\\nAt this stage, it is required to be noted that in the\\n\\npresent case, the dispute is concerning the employees\\n\\nof the Telangana State Power Utilities and Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Power Utilities.\\n\\n7.1. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 was\\n\\nenacted by Parliament to provide for the reorganization\\n\\nof the existing State of Andhra Pradesh and for\\n\\nmatters connected therewith. By Section 3, Telangana\\n\\nPage 30 of 54\\n\\nState was formed comprising of the territories\\n\\nmentioned therein and by virtue of Section 4, the State\\n\\nof Andhra Pradesh was to comprise the territories of\\n\\nthe existing state of Andhra Pradesh. Section 82 of the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 reads as\\n\\nunder:\\n\\n“82. Provision for employees of Public Sector Undertakings, etc.—On and from the appointed day, the employees of State Public Sector corporations and other Undertakings, autonomous bodies shall continue to function in such undertaking, corporation or autonomous bodies for a period of one year and during this period the corporate body concerned shall determine the modalities for distributing the personnel between the two successor States.”\\n\\n7.2. The State of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh issued\\n\\ngovernment orders for Distribution Companies, for\\n\\nGeneration Companies and for Transmission\\n\\nCorporation whereby assets and liabilities of the\\n\\naforesaid corporations and companies were\\n\\napportioned between the two new States along with the\\n\\nposts sanctioned for the employees working in those\\n\\npower sector corporations/companies. However, the\\n\\nPower Utilities of the two newly formed States (Andhra\\n\\nPage 31 of 54\\n\\nPradesh Power Utilities and Telangana Power Utilities)\\n\\ncould not arrive at any consensus with regard to\\n\\nmodalities for allocation and distribution of personnel.\\n\\nThe power utilities of Telangana unilaterally relieved\\n\\n1157 employees working with power utilities of\\n\\nTelangana to join in respective power utilities of\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh. Number of employees filed writ\\n\\npetitions in High Court challenging the decision of the\\n\\npower utilities of Telangana. 242 employees, who were\\n\\nworking in power utilities of Andhra Pradesh got\\n\\nthemselves relieved and joined in power utilities of\\n\\nTelangana. The power utilities of Telangana were\\n\\nmotivated by principle of nativity, i.e., those employees\\n\\nwhose service records mentioned them as resident of\\n\\nany part of the residuary State of Andhra Pradesh were\\n\\nrelieved and those who belonged to territory of the\\n\\nnewly formed State of Telangana were permitted to join\\n\\nat Telangana by their self\\xadoption, against which writ\\n\\npetition was filed before the High Court. The High\\n\\nCourt by its common judgment dated 02.02.2018\\n\\nallowed the writ petitions, set aside the impugned\\n\\nPage 32 of 54\\n\\naction of power utilities of Telangana relieving 1157\\n\\nemployees and issued further directions. The High\\n\\nCourt specifically disapproved the principle of nativity,\\n\\nwhich was the factor for allocation of the employees by\\n\\nthe Telangana State power utilities.\\n\\n7.3. The matter reached to this Court and this Court\\n\\nupheld the order of the High Court. However, noticing\\n\\nthat two States have not been able to arrive at any\\n\\nconsensus and to finally determine the modalities for\\n\\ndistributing the personnel between two States,\\n\\nappointed One Man Committee consisting of Justice\\n\\nD.M. Dharmadhikari, a former Judge of this Court. In\\n\\nthe order dated 28.11.2018 this Court specifically\\n\\nmade it clear that the decision of the One Man\\n\\nCommittee shall be final and binding on all the parties\\n\\nincluding Power Utility Companies of the two States as\\n\\nwell as the employees and shall be executed by all the\\n\\nparties as an order of this Court. This Court also\\n\\nobserved that in case any clarification or further\\n\\ndirection is required by any of the parties they are\\n\\nPage 33 of 54\\n\\nentitled to approach this Court by filing interlocutory\\n\\napplication in the proceedings.\\n\\n7.4. That thereafter, after considering the representation by\\n\\nall concerned and the respective stake holders, the\\n\\nCommittee on 17.04.2019 had finalised XIV modalities\\n\\nto be adopted for allocation of the personnel between\\n\\ntwo States in accordance with Section 82 of the\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. Thereafter,\\n\\nthe Telangana Power Generation Corporation Limited\\n\\nfiled an application questioning the modalities\\n\\nfinalised by One\\xadMan Committee. However, this Court\\n\\ndid not entertain the said application. That thereafter,\\n\\na report title as “Final Report of One\\xadMan Committee”\\n\\ndated 26.12.2019 was submitted by One\\xadMan\\n\\nCommittee. Along with the report, a final allocation list\\n\\nin the two States corporations/companies was\\n\\nprepared and annexed. List of 655 personnel, who\\n\\nwere to go from Telangana utilities to Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nutilities as submitted by sub\\xadCommittee Members on\\n\\nbehalf of Telangana utilities was approved by the\\n\\nPage 34 of 54\\n\\nHon’ble One\\xadMan Committee and was part of the final\\n\\nlist. That the Andhra Pradesh utilities were aggrieved\\n\\nby the final list communicated in the final report filed\\n\\nInterlocutory Applications. It was the case on behalf of\\n\\nthe Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities that the modalities\\n\\nhave not been correctly implemented and the list\\n\\nannexed is not in accordance with the modalities. This\\n\\nCourt disposed of the said application with following\\n\\nobservations:\\n\\n“This Court by the final judgment having entrusted the work of allocation to one man committee, as agreed by parties, the modalities finalized by one man committee is binding on all, to which, there is no dissension between the parties. There being no dispute regarding modalities, in event, there is some error or mistake in the working of the modalities that can be pointed out to the same committee by means of a representation and we hope and trust that the committee shall look into the said grievance and correct the error, if any. We also make it clear that if the representation is submitted by the applicant, copy of the same shall be given to the power utilities of both the Sates, who may also have liberty to submit a response to those representation, which may be considered by the one man committee. The representation be submitted within two weeks and response thereto be also submitted within two weeks thereafter.”\\n\\n7.5. After the order dated 24.01.2020, the One\\xadMan\\n\\nCommittee after deliberations with all stakeholders\\n\\nPage 35 of 54\\n\\nsubmitted a Supplementary Report dated 11.03.2020.\\n\\nIn the Supplementary Report, it was noticed that T.S.\\n\\npower utilities relieved employees numbering total 655\\n\\nto join A.P. power utilities. It also noted that Telangana\\n\\nPower Utilities are agreeable to accommodate 71\\n\\nemployees from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State\\n\\ncompanies as they are special cases like of spouses,\\n\\nmedical and handicapped employees or their\\n\\ndependents.\\n\\n7.6.\\n\\nIn the Supplementary Report, the One\\xadMan Committee\\n\\ndirected that the entire allocation process based on the\\n\\nallocation list with the Final\\n\\nReport and\\n\\nSupplementary Report be completed by 30.03.2020. A\\n\\nclarification dated 13.03.2020 was also issued by the\\n\\nOne\\xadMan Committee. Aggrieved by Supplementary\\n\\nReport,\\n\\nthe Telangana power utilities\\n\\nfiled\\n\\nMiscellaneous Application No. 920 of 2020 with regard\\n\\nto 584 employees, who were directed to be identified by\\n\\nSub\\xadCommittee Members of Andhra Pradesh. This\\n\\nCourt disposed of the said application observing that\\n\\nPage 36 of 54\\n\\nthe objections with regard to 584 employees were to be\\n\\nconsidered by One Man Committee.\\n\\n7.7. One\\xadMan Committee after the order of this Court dated\\n\\n01.05.2020 issued a Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020. In the Concluding Report, an allocation\\n\\nlist submitted by Andhra Pradesh utilities was\\n\\napproved. The Committee noticed that 655 employees\\n\\nhave been allocated from Telangana State to Andhra\\n\\nPradesh and equal numbers from Andhra Pradesh to\\n\\nTelangana including 71 names from Andhra Pradesh\\n\\nto Telangana, which was held to be of special cases\\n\\nlike spouse and medical cases. Certain further\\n\\ndirections were given by the One\\xadMan Committee in\\n\\nthe Concluding Report in paragraph 29 like approving\\n\\nthe list of Sub\\xadCommittee Members of the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh. In the Concluding Report, directions are to\\n\\nthe following effect:\\n\\n“Directions: I. In addition to the Directions contained in Para 21 of the Supplementary Report of this Committee regarding retired employees on both sides, it is further directed, that in both the States, employees who have attained or will be\\n\\nPage 37 of 54\\n\\nattaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed.\\n\\nII. In the allocation process of the present dimension and undertaken after 5 years delay, it is not possible for the Committee to satisfy individual needs and comforts and service prospects of every employee. The allocation process has been finalized on laid down principles contained in the modalities and elbow room, wherever permissible, in the modalities has been given effect to. The committee however directs the Sub Committee member of AP to re\\xad examine any left out spouse and medical cases and every attempt should be made to accommodate them in the state of their option.\\n\\nIII. All SC/ST employees cases be reexamined to accommodate them as per modality VIII in the State where they are notified as SCs or STs so as not to affect their future service growth.\\n\\nIV. All the employees finally allocated to a Public Utility will be paid regular salary from January 2020 and arrears of salary due with other benefits attached to the posts. The payments of salary partly or fully made by the Companies in the Two States in the interim period pending finalization of allocation during coronavirus pandemic, will be shared/reimbursed by the companies in the Two States mutually by paying and claiming reimbursement, if necessary, for the payments made in the interim period. It is made clear that the entire burden of salary and arrears of salary for each employee would be on the Company to which the employee is finally allocated and the said Company will reimburse interim payments pending allocation made if any by the Company to which the employee has not been finally allocated.\\n\\nV. All employees not included in the Allocation\\n\\nPage 38 of 54\\n\\nList of AP and TS and serving on \"order to serve\" basis in the Companies on the formation of the Two States in 2014 would be deemed to have been allocated to the Company where they are presently posted and working.\\n\\nVI. Based on the allocation lists, both TS and AP utilities will issue orders of posting and joining, with granting sufficient time to the employees to report for duties, keeping into consideration the constrains on movements in the current coronavirus pandemic period and the consequent lockdown imposed.\\n\\nVII. All Employers of the Power Utilities in the Two States will facilitate smooth posting and joining of employees in the Companies of the Two States and the Government and the Police Authorities of Two States will cooperate and also facilitate the movement of the employees allocated from one Company in the State to Company in another Slate.\\n\\nVIII. The allocation finally made by this committee is binding on both the employers and the employees and any violation thereof and non implementation of said allocation be reported to Supreme Court for remedial/Punitive action.”\\n\\n7.8. After the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020, a\\n\\nmember of the Sub\\xadCommittee of Andhra Pradesh\\n\\npower utilities sent a letter dated 26.06.2020 as\\n\\ncompliance report. By the said letter, 119 employees,\\n\\nwho were dropped from the list of incoming employees\\n\\nfrom Telangana State power utilities to Andhra\\n\\nPradesh power utilities and further 50 names were\\n\\nPage 39 of 54\\n\\ndropped of employees in outgoing list of employees\\n\\nfrom Andhra Pradesh power utilities to Telangana\\n\\nState power utilities and 10 further employees were\\n\\nrelieved from Andhra Pradesh power utilities for the\\n\\nreasons mentioned therein.\\n\\nAfter submission of the Concluding Report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020 and follow\\xadup action taken by the Andhra\\n\\nPradesh Power utilities, number of miscellaneous\\n\\napplications have been filed by Telangana State Power\\n\\nUtilities, by several employees as well as employees’\\n\\nassociations. The Telangana State Power Utilities\\n\\nGeneration Corporation prays for the following reliefs:\\n\\n“a) Clarify that the Concluding Report dated 20\\xad 06\\xad2020 submitted by the Hon’ble One\\xadMan Committee is illegal and arbitrary, being contrary to the Orders passed by this Hon’ble court and the Final Report dated 26\\xad12\\xad2019 submitted by the Hon’ble One\\xadMan Committee.\\n\\nb) Confirm the allocation of 1157 employees and 242 employees made by the Hon\\'ble One\\xadMan Committee as per Final Report dt. 26\\xad12\\xad2018, (i.e., the Allocation of 744 (502 +242) to TS Power Utilities and 655 from TS to AP Power utilities), as Final in terms of the Order dt. 28.11.2018 passed in present Civil Appeal. c) Clarify that the allocation of 4460 and 71 employees (4531) to TS Power Utilities vide Final Report dt. 26.12.2019 and Supplementary Report dt. 11.03.2020, is final and no further allocation to TS Power\\n\\nPage 40 of 54\\n\\nUtilities is Permissible.\\n\\nd) Clarify that the Supplementary Report in so far as Para No.27, authorizing the Member, Sub\\xad committee of AP to unilaterally identify and allocate 584 employees to TS Power Utilities is contrary to the orders dated 28\\xad11\\xad2018 in Civil Appeal No.11435/2018.\\n\\ne) Clarify the orders dated 28\\xad11\\xad2018 in Civil Appeal No. 11435 of 2018 passed by this Hon\\'bIe Court; and\\n\\nf) Pass such other or further order(s) as may be deemed fit and appropriate by this Hon’ble Court in the facts and circumstances of the present case.”\\n\\n7.9. Similar prayers were made by other Telangana Power\\n\\nUtilities. That by a detailed order dated 7.12.2020,\\n\\nthis Court dismissed the Miscellaneous Applications\\n\\nfiled by the Telangana State Power Utilities. While\\n\\ndismissing the respective Miscellaneous Applications\\n\\nfiled by the Telangana State Power Utilities which\\n\\nwere dismissed after considering in detailed the rival\\n\\nsubmissions/ objections against the final report dated\\n\\n20.06.2020, certain observations are made by this\\n\\nCourt, which are very relevant while considering the\\n\\npresent application, which are as under:\\n\\nPage 41 of 54\\n\\n40. We may further observe that the list of 655 employees submitted by Telangana State power utilities for allocation to Andhra Pradesh power utilities has been approved by the One\\xad Man Committee for which there is no dispute. The One\\xadMan Committee has undertaken exercise to identify the list of 655 employees from Andhra Pradesh power utilities to be transferred to Telangana State power utilities. The proceeding to balance the number of employees from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities being 655, we fail to understand that how the applicants can raise the issue regarding number of allocable employees to be considered by this Court in these proceedings.\\n\\n41.\\n\\nThe submission which has been much pressed by the learned counsel for the applicants is that number of employees allocated to Telangana State power utilities is much more as compared to those which have been allocated from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. The applicants have repeatedly in their application and their objection before the One\\xadMan Committee have referred to 502 out of 1157, 242 self\\xadrelieved employees and 71 spouse and medical cases plus 584 which have been permitted to be identified by Member of Andhra Pradesh Sub\\xad Committee. that The submission 502+242+71+584 becomes 1399, hence 1399 have been allocated to Telangana State power utilities as against 655, which has been allocated from Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. We may need to look into the above submission on the basis of each figure claimed by the applicant.\\n\\nis\\n\\n42.\\n\\nNow, coming to figure 502, which according to the applicant is balance from 1157 by reducing it by 655. The 502 figure as noted above, 1157 is the number of persons, which were initially\\n\\nPage 42 of 54\\n\\nrelieved by Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities unilaterally which decision was set aside by the High Court and was upheld by this Court. Out of 1157 only 655 have been allocated to Andhra Pradesh power utilities, which was approved by Final Report dated 26.12.2019 of the One\\xad Man Committee. How allocation of 502 is claimed when they are the employees, who remained on Telangana State without they being allocated to Andhra Pradesh power utilities apart from 655 from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh. Further employees working in Telangana State were allowed to remain in Telangana State, hence, allocation from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh is only 655 and addition of 502 is wholly inappropriate.\\n\\n43.\\n\\nNow, we come to number 242, which is number of self\\xadrelieved employees from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. Admittedly, 242 employees are, thus, who got themselves self\\xad relieved from Andhra Pradesh without there being any order or without there being any direction by anyone. These 242 employees were permitted joining by Telangana power utilities by its own. These 242 employees having never been allocated to nor being part of any allocation cannot be added in figure by Telangana State. Now, we come to 71, which is agreed spouse and medical ground cases by both the parties. 71 is part of 655, which is now being identified by Andhra Pradesh to be allocated to Telangana State. By taking this no.71 in Supplementary Report permitting Andhra Pradesh to identify only 584, thus, it is only 584+71, i.e., 655 employees, which are now being sought to be allocated to the Telangana State by One Man Committee. We, thus, do not find any merit in the contention of the applicant that 1399 employees have been allocated to Telangana State as against 655 allocated from Telangana State to Andhra\\n\\nPage 43 of 54\\n\\nPradesh.\\n\\n46.\\n\\nThe objection that list of 584 is not out of 2165 was considered by the One\\xadMan Committee, which is reflected from the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020. The above objection has been duly considered and answered by the One\\xadMan Committee in paragraphs 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Concluding Report, which is to the following effect:\\xad\\n\\n“25. The second submission on behalf of TS is that with the Supplementary Report, this Committee had Identified total 2165 employees in the list given to AP Sub for proposing Committee member allocation from that list. It is urged on behalf of TS, that allocation list proposed by AP is not out of 2165 listed employees with the Supplementary Report of this Committee.\\n\\n26. It is true, as urged on behalf of TS, that with the Supplementary Report, this Committee had identified 2165 employees bused on modality Nos. 5 which requires consideration of every employee for his home district and his adjustment as far as possible in the State in which his home district falls.\\n\\n27. This Committee has to be open to correction. The Committee is also of the view that modality No. V alone is not decisive and modalities no. I to IV are to be cumulatively taken into consideration and applied to make allocation in proportion to the available posts in each Company in the Two States. TS side has accepted that 114 employees from out of 584 employees proposed for allocation by A.P to T.S are included in 2165 employees identified by this Committee in the lint\\n\\nPage 44 of 54\\n\\nannexed with Supplementary Report. The remaining 470 employees (falling outside 2165 employees identified with the supplementary report) have been proposed by A.P for T.S in the report of the Sub Committee Member. The justification shown is that it is to match the number of employees with the available posts in various companies.\\n\\n28. In the above circumstances, mentioned above, this Committee finds the Allocation Lists company\\xadwise and post\\xadwise proposed by AP deserves approval and it is so approved.”\\n\\n48.\\n\\nNow, one more objection of the applicants, which needs to be noticed is the objection that even the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020 is not final report and Sub\\xadCommittee Member of Andhra Pradesh has been authorised to modify the list. Applicants have referred to direction Nos. I, II and III of the Concluding Report, which is to the following effect:\\xad\\n\\nI. In addition to the Directions contained in Para 21 of the Supplementary Report of this Committee regarding retired employees on both sides, it is further directed, that in both the States, employees who have attained or will be attaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed.\\n\\nII. In the allocation process of the present dimension and undertaken after 5 years delay, it is not possible for the Committee to satisfy individual needs and comforts and service prospects of every employee. The allocation process has been finalized on laid down principles contained in the modalities and elbow room, wherever\\n\\nPage 45 of 54\\n\\npermissible, in the modalities has been given effect to. The committee however directs the Sub Committee member of AP to re\\xadexamine any left\\xadout spouse and medical cases and every attempt should be made to accommodate them in the state of their option.\\n\\nIII. All SC/ST employees cases be reexamined to accommodate them as per modality VIII in the State where they are notified as SCs or STs so as not to affect their future service growth.\\n\\n49.\\n\\nNow, we first take the direction No.I of the One Man Committee that those who have attained or will be attaining 58 Years of age in the year 2020 will be kept out of the allocation process and their names in the Allocation Lists will be removed. in paragraph 21, the One\\xadMan Committee has stated:\\xad\\n\\nIn Supplementary Report\\n\\n“21. It was also agreed by the Parties that all retired employees between years 2014 to 2020 in each Power Utility in each State need not be displaced only for pensioner benefits payable to them.”\\n\\n50.\\n\\nThe above indicates that both the parties had agreed before the One\\xadMan Committee that all retired employees between years 2014 to 2020 in each power utility in each State need not be displaced. Thus, the above was agreement between both the parties before the One\\xadMan Committee and direction No.I only an extension of the said agreement, i.e., whoever shall be attaining 58 years of age in 2020 shall be kept out of allocation process. As per paragraph 21 of the Supplementary Report, those, who retire till then were already kept out of the allocation and the extension till the end of 2020 cannot be said to be unreasonable. The allocation process\\n\\nPage 46 of 54\\n\\nbeing not yet finalised and awaiting finalisation for last several years, those who retire either in Telangana State or Andhra Pradesh has rightly been decided not to be displaced only for the purpose of shouldering pensionary liability. The direction No.I is equitable.\\n\\n51.\\n\\nThe applicants further submit that after the Concluding Report dated 20.06.2020 by letter dated 26.06.2020, Andhra Pradesh power utilities have struck 119 names from the incoming 655 list from the Telangana State power utilities to Andhra Pradesh power utilities. We are of the view that the said dropping is only consequential to the decision of the One\\xadMan Committee as reflected in paragraph 21 of Supplementary Report and direction No.I of Concluding Report. The Andhra Pradesh power utilities have also deleted 50 names from the list of 584 employees outgoing from Andhra Pradesh power utilities to Telangana State power utilities, which was again in compliance of the One\\xadMan Committee’s decision. Any consequential action taken in pursuance of the Concluding Report cannot be said to be not contemplated by the final Concluding Report or cannot be said to be an open ended report. The consequence of Concluding Report has to be taken to its logical ends. Further, 10 employees have been added by direction Nos. II and the reasons have been given in the letter dated 26.06.2020 for relieving them, which is again consequence of direction Nos.I and II. We, thus, are of the view that the One\\xadMan Committee has considered all materials and objections placed before it by both sides including the representation of the employees and employees organisations submitted from time to time. The process which was initiated by submitting Final Report dated 26.12.2019 was supplemented by Supplementary Report dated 11.03.2020 and\\n\\nPage 47 of 54\\n\\nConcluding Report dated 20.06.2020. The One\\xad Man Committee being aware of all objections and having taken a conscious decision to finalise the allocation between two States, we do not find any such error in the process which may warrant any clarification or direction by this Court. We may further notice that the exercise undertaken by the One\\xadMan Committee is to allocate 655 from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh and same number from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. Apart from the above two allocations, other personnel, who were working in Telangana State and Andhra Pradesh were not disturbed by allocation.\\n\\n52.\\n\\nLearned counsel for the applicants have also taken exception to reciprocity of 655 number. We do not find that there is any error in reciprocity. The One\\xadMan Committee took a decision that when 655 employees are coming from Telangana State to Andhra Pradesh, same number should go from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana State. In the Concluding Report, final list has been annexed, which is utility\\xad wise and personnel\\xadwise, which is clear and unambiguous. We, thus, do not find any merit in the Miscellaneous Applications filed by Telangana State power utilities being M.A. Nos. 1286, 1290, 1292 and 1291, which are dismissed.”\\n\\n8.0. Thus, from the above, it is apparent that this Court\\n\\nspecifically observed and held that the Final Report\\n\\ndated 26.12.2019 submitted by the One Man\\n\\nCommittee along with allocation list is final and\\n\\nconclusive and is binding to both the States and\\n\\nPage 48 of 54\\n\\nrespective Power Utilities viz. Telangana Power\\n\\nUtilities and Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities. The only\\n\\nexception was with respect to those employees who\\n\\nattained the age of 58 years in the year 2020. Those\\n\\nemployees with the consent of the respective Power\\n\\nUtilities were kept out of allocation process. It is to be\\n\\nnoted that the respective applicants – 84 petitioners\\n\\nfigured in the final list prepared by One Man\\n\\nCommittee. The names of the petitioners are duly\\n\\nmentioned in the said list of the One Man Committee\\n\\nReport which is prepared Utilities wise. Out of 84\\n\\npetitioners and as per the Final List of 28 petitioners\\n\\nhad to be absorbed in TS Genco, 35 petitioners had to\\n\\nbe absorbed in TS Transco and 21 petitioners had to\\n\\nbe absorbed in TS Discoms. As observed herein\\n\\nabove, the respective Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities\\n\\nhave already relieved respective petitioners and\\n\\nthereafter they are no more continued with their\\n\\nerstwhile employers – Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities\\n\\nrespectively. Therefore, once the names of the 84\\n\\npetitioners figured in the Final List prepared by the\\n\\nPage 49 of 54\\n\\nOne Man Committee and the Final Report has been\\n\\naccepted and approved by this Court and it is directed\\n\\nthat both the States and their respective State Power\\n\\nUtilities are bound by the Final Report of the One\\n\\nMan Committee and Final List prepared and\\n\\ncommunicated with the Supplementary Report / Final\\n\\nReport, thereafter any deviation from the same would\\n\\ntantamount to willful disobedience of the directions\\n\\nissued by this Court. At this stage, it is required to be\\n\\nnoted that in the earlier order, this Court has\\n\\nspecifically observed and made it clear that the\\n\\ndecision of the One Man Committee shall be final and\\n\\nbinding on all the parties including the Power Utilities\\n\\nCompanies of the two States as well as employees and\\n\\nshall be executed by all the parties as an order of this\\n\\nCourt. In that view of the matter, the respective\\n\\nsubsequent office orders dated 17.12.2020 (issued by\\n\\nthe TS Genco), office order dated 18.12.2020 (issued\\n\\nby the TS Transco), office order dated 18.12.2020\\n\\n( issued by the TSNPDCL) and the office order dated\\n\\n19.12.2020 (issued by the TSSPDCL) are just contrary\\n\\nPage 50 of 54\\n\\nto the directions issued by this Court and contrary to\\n\\nthe Supplementary Report / Final Report submitted\\n\\nby the One Man Committee dated 20.06.2020 which\\n\\nwould tantamount to willful disobedience of the\\n\\ndirections issued by this Court. Again, the Telangana\\n\\nState Power Utilities have raised the same issues with\\n\\nrespect to the Reciprocity and Financial Neutrality,\\n\\nwhich were earlier raised before this court by filing\\n\\nrespective Miscellaneous Applications and same came\\n\\nto be dismissed by this court vide order dated\\n\\n7.12.2020. Thereafter, to raise the same objections /\\n\\nissues again by the Telangana State Power Utilities\\n\\nwould tantamount to willful disobedience of the\\n\\ndirections issued by this Court. Telangana State\\n\\nPower Utilities cannot be permitted to raise the same\\n\\nobjections / issues again and again, which were\\n\\nearlier raised before this Court and this Court held\\n\\nagainst the Telangana State Power Utilities. There\\n\\nmust be an end to a litigation. By permitting the\\n\\nTelangana State Power Utilities and /or any other\\n\\nparties to raise the issues / objections again and\\n\\nPage 51 of 54\\n\\nagain, the object and purpose of constituting One\\n\\nMan Committee by this Court would be frustrated.\\n\\nThis Court purposefully directed to constitute the One\\n\\nMan Committee consisting of Mr. Justice D M\\n\\nDharmadhikari, Former Judge of this Court to put an\\n\\nend to the litigation with respect to the allocation of\\n\\nthe employees and other disputes with respect to the\\n\\nrespective Power Utilities of both the States. It is very\\n\\nunfortunate that the State of Telangana and\\n\\nTelangana Power Utilities have continued to re\\xadagitate\\n\\nthe issues, which are already held against them\\n\\nearlier.\\n\\n9.0.\\n\\nIn view of the above and for the reasons stated above,\\n\\nwe hold the respective Telangana Power Utilities for\\n\\nwillful and deliberate disobedience of the judgment\\n\\nand order passed by this Court dated 7.12.2020 in\\n\\nMA No.1270 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.11435 of 2018\\n\\nand other allied Miscellaneous Applications and we\\n\\nhold them guilty for the contempt for the same, for\\n\\nwhich, they are liable to be suitably punished. At this\\n\\nPage 52 of 54\\n\\nstage, it is required to be noted that as observed\\n\\nherein above, the petitioners are already relieved by\\n\\nthe Andhra Pradesh Power Utilities since long and\\n\\nbecause of the aforesaid office orders the respective\\n\\npetitioners are not permitted to join in the respective\\n\\nTelangana Power Utilities and their future is at stake\\n\\nand they are without any salary from the date they\\n\\nare relieved by the respective Andhra Pradesh Power\\n\\nUtilities. Before we pass any further order on the\\n\\nsentence / punishment, we give one additional\\n\\nopportunity to the respective Telangana Power\\n\\nUtilities i.e. TS Genco, TS Transco, TSSPDCL and\\n\\nTSNPDCL to comply with the directions issued by this\\n\\nCourt in the final judgment and order dated\\n\\n7.12.2020 and Concluding Final Report submitted by\\n\\nthe One Man Committee dated 20.06.2020 and to\\n\\nabsorb all the respective petitioners in the respective\\n\\nTelangana Power Utilities / establishment as per the\\n\\nlist approved by the One Man Committee which would\\n\\nhave a direct bearing on the punishment / sentence\\n\\nto be imposed. We give further two weeks’ time to\\n\\nPage 53 of 54\\n\\nrespective Telangana Power Utilities / Corporation to\\n\\nabsorb the petitioners. We also direct the respective\\n\\nTelangana Power Utilities viz. TS Genco, TS Transco,\\n\\nTSSPDCL and TSNPDCL to pay salary and other\\n\\nservice benefits to the petitioners from the day they\\n\\nare relieved by the respective Andhra Pradesh Power\\n\\nUtilities, to be implemented within two weeks.\\n\\nPut up on 31.10.2022 for further order.\\n\\n…………………………………J.\\n\\n(M.

To defeat the provisions of law, a device is at times adopted by unscrupulous tenants and sub-tenants of bringing into existence a deed of partnership which gives the relationship of tenant and sub-tenant an outward appearance of partnership while in effect what has come into existence is a sub-tenancy or parting with possession camouflaged under the cloak of partnership. Merely because a tenant has entered into a partnership he cannot necessarily be held to have sub-let the premises or parted with possession thereof in favour of his partners. If the tenant is actively associated with the partnership business and retains the use and control over the tenancy premises with him, maybe along with the partners, the tenant may not be said to have parted with possession. However, if the user and control of the tenancy premises has been parted with and deed of partnership has been drawn up as an indirect method of collecting the consideration for creation of sub-tenancy or for providing a cloak or cover to conceal a transaction not permitted by law, the court is not estopped from tearing the veil of partnership and finding out the real nature of transaction entered into between the tenant and the alleged sub- tenant.\n",

            "premises remain in occupation of the tenant or in his control, a mere entering into partnership may not provide a ground for eviction by running into conflict with prohibition against sub-letting or parting with possession. This is a general statement of law which ought to be read in the light of the lease agreement and the law governing the tenancy. There are cases wherein the tenant sub-lets the premises or parts with possession in defiance of the terms of lease or the rent control legislation and in order to save himself from the peril of eviction brings into existence, a deed of partnership between him and his sub-lessee to act as a cloak on the reality of the transaction. The existence of deed of partnership between the tenant and the alleged sub-tenant would not preclude the landlord from bringing on record material and circumstances, by adducing evidence or by means of cross- examination, making out a case of sub-letting or parting with possession or interest in tenancy premises by the tenant in favour of a third person. The rule as to exclusion of oral by documentary evidence governs the parties to the deed in writing. A stranger to the document is not bound by the terms of the document and is, therefore, not excluded from demonstrating the untrue or collusive nature of the document or the fraudulent or illegal purpose for which it was brought into being. An enquiry into reality of transaction is not excluded merely by availability of writing reciting the transaction. Tyagaraja Mudaliyar v. Vedathanni, AIR 1936 PC 70 : 63 IA 126 is an authority for the proposition that oral evidence in departure from the terms of a written deed is admissible to show that what is mentioned in the deed was not the real transaction between the parties but it was something different.

            "Broadly, independent India faced three kinds of challenges during the struggle for independence. The first and the immediate challenge was to shape a nation that was united, yet accommodative of the diversity in our society. India was a land of continental size and diversity. Its people spoke different languages and followed different cultures and religions. At that time, it was widely believed that a country full of such kinds of diversity could not remain together for long. The partition of the country appeared to prove everyone’s worst fears. There were serious questions about the future of India: Would India survive as a unified country? Would it do so by emphasizing national unity at the cost of every other objective? Would it mean rejecting all regional and sub-national identities? And there was an urgent question: How was integration of the territory of India to be achieved?\n",

            "The third challenge was to ensure the development and well-being of the entire society and not only of some sections. The Constitution granted fundamental rights and extended the right to vote to every citizen. The Constitution also set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy the welfare goals that democratic politics must achieve. The real challenge now was to evolve effective policies for economic development and eradication of poverty.\n",

In a memorandum to the Supreme Court, he had said that every good ruler ‘will be anxious to afford every individual the readiest means of bringing to his notice whatever may require his interference. To secure this important object, the unrestricted liberty of publication is the only effectual means that can be employed.’\n"
